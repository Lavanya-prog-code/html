<p><h2><u>1.what is a programming language?</u></h2></p>
<p>Ans.1.A<b> programming language </b>is a formal system of instructions used to communicate with a computer.<br>
2.enables developers to write the programmes for various tasks such as web development ,data analysis and automation.<br>
3.examples are <b> c, java, python ,java script.</b> <br>

<h2><u>2.what is python?</u></h2>
<p>Ans.1.<b> python </b> is a high-level, interpreted programming language known for its simplicity and readability.it was created by <b> Guido van Rossum </b>in he late 1980s and first released in <b> 1991 </b>.python emphasizes <b> code readability </b> and supports multiple programming paradigms <b> object oriented ,procedural and functional programming. </b><br>
2.older than java(1995).</p>

<h2><u>3.why python?</u></h2>
<p>ans.1. <b> Ease of Use:</b> Simple syntax, ideal for beginners.<br>
2. <b> Versatility:</b> Supports multiple programming paradigms (object-oriented, procedural, functional).<br>
3. <b> Extensive Libraries:</b> Rich ecosystem for tasks like data analysis, machine learning, and web development.<br>
4. <b> Community Support:</b> Large and active community for troubleshooting and learning.<br>
5. <b> Interpreted Language:</b> Python is executed line by line, which makes debugging easier.<br>
6. <b> Cross-Platform:</b> Python programs can run on various platforms without modification (Windows, macOS, Linux).<br>
7. <b> Scalability:</b> While often seen as a scripting language, Python scales well for larger applications when combined with appropriate frameworks or tools (e.g django)</p>

<h2><u>4.python installation:</u></h2>
<p>1.<b> download link:</b> <u>download python/python.org</u><br>
2.<b> commands to check installations:</b><br>
	a.in cmd python --version<br>
	b.python --V</p>
<h2><u>5.where python is used?</u></h2>
<p>Ans 1. <b> Web Development: </b> Frameworks: Django, Flask.<br>
2. <b> Data Science and Machine Learning </b>: Predictive modeling and data analysis using NumPy, Pandas, TensorFlow, scikit-learn.<br>
3. <b> Automation (Scripting): </b> Automating repetitive tasks.<br>
4. <b> Game Development: </b> Framework: PyGame.<br>
5. <b> Scientific Computing: </b> Libraries: SciPy, Matplotlib.<br>
6. <b> Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Deep Learning: </b>Libraries: Keras, PyTorch.<br>
7. <b> Web Scraping: Libraries: </b> BeautifulSoup, Scrapy.<br>
8. <b> Cybersecurity: </b> Used for creating tools to test system vulnerabilities.</p>
